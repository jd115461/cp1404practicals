# CP1404 Practicals Repository

This repository contains my practical programming work for **CP1404 – Programming II** at James Cook University.  
It includes weekly practicals focused on applying the learnt work, improving python skills and clean coding practices.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Harrison Preston — an Electrical & Electronic Engineering student at JCU learning new coding languages trying to
write more efficient, cleaner and maintainable code
This repo demonstrates my progress throughout the subject.

## 3 key lessons on clean coding practices

- **Use meaningful names**  
  Variables, functions, and classes should clearly describe their purpose.
- **Write clear and correct docstrings**  
  Include docstrings for functions and classes to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values, making the code
  easier to understand and maintain.
- **Avoid repetition (DRY principle)**  
  Reuse code instead of duplicating logic when appropriate.
