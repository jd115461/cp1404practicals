# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

All of week 2 lecture videos and majority of week 1 just a few more to catch up on, so i would estimate 85 to 90%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have set aside around 3 hours on Friday, during late morning / afternoon.
The location is either at my desk or in the Engineering Building at Uni if i don't have anything to do after or feel
like i will be unable to focus.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

completing the practicals and the little tasks during the lecture videos. As well as showing up to all classes and
asking my peers for assistance when needed.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to make sure i get everything completed in the allocated time as well as making sure i plan my day around getting
through all the tasks.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

In the practicals so far i think the only thing I am really doing poorly with is struglling to gte the task done in the
allocated practical time, however this just means i finnish them in my own time.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I am doing well in attempting the practicals myself, then self checking my answers with the solutions.
I see this as a really strong resource as it also allows us to see whats different and modify our and learn from the
differences and mistakes we might have made.
