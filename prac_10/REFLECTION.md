# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was usually pretty good. there was only two times where my estimate was well under by about an hour
or so. Other than that there were obviously minor differences but not many massive over or underestimates.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over the course of the subject i think my accuracy improved on topics i was stronger at and stayed pretty similar with
new more unfamiliar topics i covered less.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

These estimates helped teach me to be more conscious of my time and how long i am actually spending doing topics and
task
and how i should try and find ways to optimise things.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Honestly not much. I only had two of my code review actually review and one of them was generic with no actual advice.
However in the one proper review i received i learnt to adjust my docstrings and names more to make them better and more
accurate.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I was also only requested to do two code reviews but doing them helped me look at the code in a different way. trying to
find issues and things that should be improved to help me and the coder become better.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 7 feedback]([https://github.com/jd115459/cp1404practicals/pull/3])

### Explanation

For my prac 7 code review i gave, i think the good points were that i gave some actual feedback. instead of saying the
code looks good i tried to find some small very minor issues that might me them try and become better coders in the
future if they decide to take the advice on.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 8 feedback](https://github.com/jd113272/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

For the code review I mainly focused on the comments and how comments should only be added to code not understandable
for a coder of my level and as there were excessive and simple comments i suggested reducing the number. Another key
suggestion was to make sure docstrings were added as they are very important.

# Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If i was in charge of the subject one thing i might do is add brief walkthrough videos for the more challenging tasks to
support independent learning. This would be done after the due date so student are actually able to try and finnish of
the difficult and longer tasks if they choose. It'll also help with study for the exam i believe.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

For the practicals I believe I broke tasks into smaller steps and by testing my work regularly and commiting i was able
to show iterative development and improve my code debugging and problem-solving.
