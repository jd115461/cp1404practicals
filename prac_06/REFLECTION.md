# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I started doing the additional and extension work to help with my understanding and applying the learnt work. I have also utilised class time more appropriately and have been getting the task completed. 
If they haven't been completed I will finnish them at uni after the prac session.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

In terms of my approach to the subject one thing i need to change would be ensuring i start the lecture videos at an earlier point in the week so they are covered and i have time to go over stuff again i need too to help reinforce the learning and content. 
Time on task is alright maybe need to try and improve how long its taking me to complete certain pracs and examples when certain topics are used. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently attending practical sessions and remaining engaged throughout the activities. The learning is pretty interesting to me so that helps me stay engaed with the content.
attempting extra exercises has also help me a bit i fell to understand the content better which helps me struggle less adn enjoy it more.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop delaying starting weekly content until later in the week. This sometimes makes it harder to absorb the material and increases pressure.
I also want to stop rushing through the tasks so much just to complete them but try and understand and question why we are doing stuff this was ect to help with my understanding of the content.  

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think the only thing ive noticed so far is that at the end of a seminar session when we are doing big coding problems somtimes we run out of time to get a solution from Lindsay's point of view.
so i guess if we could get thought processes and solutions ot that it could help. while the seminar examples are similar to the lecture content stuff there are still some differences that could help with my learning if they were covered.
Otherwise i have no other suggestions.
